*Location:* Oak Ridge, TN, US, 37831

*Company: * Oak Ridge National Laboratory

Requisition Id 3784 

 

*Purpose: * 

The Remote-Sensing Group in the National Security Emerging Technology
(NSET) Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) seeks to hire a
technical professional for data analysis and coding in support of remote
sensing research and development.  The successful candidate will advance
their expertise and skills while collaborating on research and
development that supports national security projects. 

 

As a staff member on our team in the National Security Sciences
Directorate, you will work on challenging, multi-disciplinary projects
that involve a wide variety of applications, delivery platforms,
programming languages, and architectures.  You will apply your skills in
real-world, large-scale computing projects.  You will work alongside
Gordon Bell finalists proposing state of the art computing solutions for
such hardware as Summit—the fastest supercomputer in the world—and
Frontier.  You will apply your innovative experience toward geospatial
applications, contributing to activities that span from research to
deployed solutions in an agile processing framework.  Your efforts will
provide insight into shaping the direction of our fast-paced, rewarding
program.

 

The function of this position is to provide support in the acquisition,
manipulation, and processing of geospatial data, both structured and
unstructured.  The successful candidate for this job will support a wide
variety of projects involving photogrammetry, image science, computer
vision, and machine learning.  The candidate must be comfortable working
as part of a tightly integrated team and must be capable of supporting
multiple projects simultaneously.

 

 

*Job Duties and Responsibilities:*

Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

  * Support applied remote sensing, imaging science, and photogrammetric
    development, with a strong emphasis on coding and testing support
    for orbital and aerial data collection platforms, 
  * Support data queries and collection from various commercial
    platforms and sensors such as the EVWHS from Maxar, Planet Explorer
    from PlanetLabs, EarthExplorer from the USGS, and unmanned aircraft
    system (UAS) collections, Also support government owned/sponsored
    sources.  
  * Assist with machine-learning model testing and evaluation prior to
    release of new software, beta software, and updates to currently
    deployed software or applications,
  * Support development software that enables scalable and
    high-performance data generation, analysis, and distribution across
    desktop and enterprise systems.  Must be able to work with and add
    to existing code bases that may or may not originate from within the
    remote sensing group. 
  * Work with researchers, as well as internal and external project
    sponsors, to capture, understand, integrate, and test their
    requirements in developed software.
  * Report results in open literature journals, technical reports,
    software releases, and at relevant conferences, when sponsoring
    agencies permit.

 

 

*Basic Requirements:*

  * Bachelor’s degree in photogrammetry, image science, remote sensing,
    geomatics, civil engineering, geography, geographic information
    science, computer science or computer engineering, environmental
    engineering, electrical engineering, physics, mathematics, or
    natural sciences.
  * Five years or more years of professional experience in remote
    sensing or in a field relevant to remote sensing.
  * Experience working with remote sensing imagery and geographic metadata.
  * Experience solving remote sensing and GIS problems in a language
    such as Julia, Python, R, C++, IDL, or MATLAB.
  * Familiarity with geospatial, image processing, and data science
    software and libraries such as QGIS, GDAL, NumPy/SciPy, and Pandas.
  * This position requires the ability to obtain and maintain a
    clearance from the Department of Energy. As such, this position is a
    Workplace Substance Abuse (WSAP) testing designated position. WSAP
    positions require passing a pre-placement drug test and
    participation in an ongoing random drug testing program.

  * Master’s degree in photogrammetry, image science, remote sensing,
    geomatics, civil engineering, geography, geographic information
    science, computer science or computer engineering, environmental
    engineering, electrical engineering, physics, mathematics, or
    natural sciences.
  * Excellent communication (oral and written), organization, and
    decision-making skills.  Strong interpersonal skills and working
    effectively as a team member are essential.

    standards, especially NITF.
  * Familiarity with Linux, git, and GIS databases.
  * Multi-sensor and multimodal data fusion experience.
  * Experience with machine learning and high-performance computing
    relating to remote sensing research.
  * Experience with both passive and active remote sensing.
  * Experience with implementing HPC workflows for large scale remote
    sensing applications.
  * An understanding of atmospheric science and applications.
  * A strong desire to expand on your existing programming experience,
    and to scale remote sensing research to very large data sets.

 

This position will remain open for a minimum of 5 days after which it
will close when a qualified candidate is identified and/or hired.
