Requisition Id 3800 

*Overview:  *

The Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division (RNSD) at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) seeks applications for the position of Research Staff
Member.

 

The primary mission of the Used Fuel Systems (UFS) group is to develop
and provide engineering solutions, nuclear safety analysis capabilities,
and leadership and support for the safe, secure, and effective
management and disposition of used nuclear fuel (UNF) and high-level
radioactive waste (HLW). The UFS group leads and manages projects
focused on the continued safe and secure storage, transportation, and
eventual geologic disposal of UNF. These projects include the
development of integrated system solutions for UNF and HLW. This
position will report to the Used Fuel Systems Group Leader and will
collaborate closely with other ORNL groups in areas such as UNF
characterization, criticality safety, thermal analyses, radiation
shielding, systems analyses, facility design, material performance,
destructive and nondestructive UNF measurements, and material safeguards
and security.

 

*Major Duties/Responsibilities:  *

  * Collaborate within a multidisciplinary, multi-laboratory environment
    consisting of computational scientists, computer scientists,
    experimentalists, and engineers/physicists developing and
    demonstrating applied technology to solving technical problems for
    engineering or technical projects and functions supported
  * Participate in and lead large complex nuclear safety analyses
    focusing on integrated spent fuel storage, transportation, and
    disposal applications
  * Represent work performed by the group for internal and external
    review, providing presentations to sponsors and the general public
    as necessary
  * Contribute to technical papers, journal articles, reports, and
    proposals for internal and external release, and represent the

    address the requirements of 10 CFRs 50, 71, and 72 and existing
    regulatory guidance
  * Experience with finite element and/or computation fluid dynamics codes
  * Understanding of measurement uncertainty and derivation of system
    uncertainty; verification and validation; the relationship between
    theory, experiments, and simulation; and visualization and
    interpretation of experimental and simulation data
  * Experience in thermal analyses for passive cooling as encountered in
    dry storage systems and groundwater effects
  * Working knowledge of industry operations and practice for spent fuel
    management, including ASME NQA-1 quality assurance program requirements
  * Prior experience participating in engineering design teams
    developing technical specifications, topical reports, and safety
    analysis reports (SARs)
  * Excellent interpersonal, presentation, and writing skills to enable
    effective interaction and communication with technical peers,
    program managers, and sponsors
