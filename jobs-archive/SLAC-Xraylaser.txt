SLAC  National  Accelerator  Laboratoryseeks  a Research  Associatefor  a  joint  position  atthe  Linac Coherent Light Sources (LCLS) and the DOE-BES Center  for Materials Science entitled "Computational Synthesis of Materials Software Project with Validation on Layered Low Dimensional Functional Materials and Ultra-Fast X-Ray LaserExperiments"at the Stanford PULSE Institute.SLAC is one of the world’s premier research laboratories, providing an internationally leading capability in the form of its accelerator based light sources and its science programs, including the world’s first hard x-ray free electron laser(xFEL)the LCLS.The  successful  candidate  will  share  his  or  her  efforts  to  develop  and  carry  out specific X-ray  laser experimentsfor  materials  characterization, and help  operate,  develop,  and  utilize  LCLSmore  generally. Responsibilities include but are not limited to the following: Develop and carry-outresearchutilizing ultrafast time resolved X-ray methods(e.g., scattering, emission and absorption spectroscopy)and/or electron scattering methods, leading to a better understanding of materials, including novel stacked two-dimensional layered materials.Contribute to the science and user support programatLCLS.Assist in the development of new instrumentation and analysis methodsfor xFEL based studies.Work togetherwith the diverse workforce at SLAC, external collaborators,and LCLS users.Note:Research  Associates  at  SLAC  are  fixed  term  academic  appointments.  Research  Associates  are engaged  with  the  design,  support,  operation  and/or  scientific  exploitation  of  the  major  programs  of  the laboratory,  under  the  guidance  of  their  faculty  or  Senior  Staff  Scientist  /  Distinguished  Staff  Scientist supervisor. They are expected to work with a significant degree of independence on one or more specific tasks in support of the research program, frequently interacting with the laboratory’s scientific community.  Required Skills: A Ph.D. in Physics, Chemistry, orrelated field.Strong analytical and experimentalskills.Demonstrated effective written and verbal communication skills.Demonstrated ability to work and communicate effectively with a diverse population.Demonstrated ability to work independently and in a team environment.Applicants will be evaluatedon research experience and accomplishments in field of expertise.Desired Skills: Experience with DOE funded national lab research.Experience with user facility operations and research.Expertise in X-rayand/or electronscattering and X-ray spectroscopy techniques.Experience with optical laser/X-rayor electronpump-probe techniques.Experience with X-ray free electron laser based research.
