    BUILD THE FUTURE 

The Role:

This position in the Manufacturing Innovations Team will focus on driving the design and engineering of R&D prototypes using scientific insights and state-of-the art simulation tools like finite element analysis. You will analyze new technology devices on a variety of aspects such as mechanical, thermal, optical behavior. You will provide actionable feedback and design guidelines to the team members and have a hands-on approach to manufacturing.  You will be able to implement from scratch simple numerical simulation tools when commercial solutions are not available, which happens when dealing with new technologies.

This role involves collaboration with designers, engineering, manufacturing, and commercial teams and requires the ability to distill highly technical information and effectively communicate with other teams and management.

Responsibilities:

    Perform thermo-mechanical and optical simulations of new technology components such as innovative glass or polymer components, in order to guide the innovation process and influence the design at an R&D stage. Examples of components are windshields, glass windows, vision systems, exterior materials, acoustic materials.
    Lead the prototyping and analysis of innovative R&D component and provide a scientific analysis of the performance, such as ability to manufacture, fracture resistance, optical clarity.
    Interact with the design team and provide clear and easy to understand feedback about the design
    Develop new knowledge in areas required by the investigation of new technologies, with an analysis rooted in fundamental physics and mathematics, use problem solving and critical thinking abilities
    Propose innovative concepts that will benefit our products

 

Requirements:

    BS/MS Degree in Mechanical, Materials Engineering, Physics, Mathematics or related field
    Deep understanding of physics (continuum mechanics, Maxwell equations, fluid dynamics) and mathematics (linear algebra, tensor calculus, partial differential equations, numerical analysis)
    Coding skills with at least one programming language such as Python, C++,Java or similar
    Experience with CAD software and finite element analysis is appreciated
